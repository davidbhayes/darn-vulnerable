THIS PLUGIN IS DESIGNED AS A TEACHING TOOL AND IS NOT TO BE RUN IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES

# The DARN Vulnerable Plugin

To run this plugin, a constant must be defined, `LOAD_INTENTIONAL_VULNS` and set to true. If not, it doesn't run.

The idea of the plugin is that it makes a audit-log of failed logins.

It is the work of Jon Cave, lightly editted for staying within my sensitive preferences of language.
